    :Keep note of what is being worked on here. PLEASE UPDATE BEFORE PUSHING:


New Additions (Most recent on top):

    - Re-organized global variables. Got rid of windowID and started checking window flags instead.

    - Added features to sequencer window.

    - Added Sequencer class (sequence_list.h)


To do:

    - Complete sequencer sub-window.

    - Add master speed and block length controls to track params sub-window.

    - Add another start key-command that starts from the beginning of the block.

    - Add command functionality.


    Note: Use the Sequencer class in sequence_list.h as a base reference for all new sub-windows.

    - Add help sub-window to provide a detailed guide on how to use the program.

    - Add sub-window to load samples. Use load_inst() from tracker class.

    - Add sub-window to edit instrument parameters.

    - Add sub-window to edit samples.

    - Add sub-window to save and load modules.

    - Add config sub-window and move all the customizable values in global.h to the config file.


Bugs:

    - Jitter occurs when block speed changes during sequence playback.

    - Note triggers when using key commands.
      Ex: CNTRL+o plays the o key's coresponding note when opening the sequence sub-window.
