    :Keep note of what is being worked on here. PLEASE UPDATE BEFORE PUSHING:


New Additions (Most recent on top):



To do:

    - Copy/paste in sample edit doesn't transfer the sample rate. (sample rate is 0)

    - Remove testing code for ctrl+s and ctrl+l in main window once finished

    - Finish disk op window.

    - Add 'extend note input' feature to the skip function.

    - Add (append/insert to seq) buttons to block sub-window.

    - Add master speed and block length controls to track params sub-window.

    - Add channel mute.

    - Add help sub-window to provide a detailed guide on how to use the program.

    - Add config sub-window and move all the customable values in global.h to the config file.


Bugs:

    - One of the tracker commands sometimes causes the following error after the program is quit:
      double free or corruption (!prev)
      Aborted

    - Scope generation process stops audio some channels prematurely and causes distortion in others.
      This bug occurs randomly...  :/ ???
      It doesn't seem to occur when the generate_scope function is commented out.
      Removing the unused element from the block struct in tracker.h 'char *array;' makes the bug persistent.. ???
