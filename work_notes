    :Keep note of what is being worked on here:

To do:
    Implement code to run the sequencer.
    Use some sort of interrupt to prioritize the timing of the sequencer.

    Add help sub-window to provide a detailed guide on how to use the program.

    Add sub-window to load samples. Use load_inst() from tracker class.

    Add sub-window to edit samples.

    Add sub-window to edit instrument parameters.

    Find a more efficient way to render the text inside the sequencer.
    Something other than SDL_TTF.
