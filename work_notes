    :Keep note of what is being worked on here:

New Additions:
    - Added ability to change block with shift+arrows inside block sub-window
    - Added note copy/paste with shift+alt+0-9 / shift+0-9
    - separated step texture creation from rendering. Split render_steps() to render_steps() & update_steps()
    - Added skip modes and skip toggle

To do:

    - Add command functionality.

    - Add help sub-window to provide a detailed guide on how to use the program.

    - Add sub-window to load samples. Use load_inst() from tracker class.

    - Add sub-window to edit instrument parameters.

    - Add sub-window to edit samples.

    - Add sub-window to save and load modules.


Bugs:

    - Timing is still a little sloppy at higher speeds or with lots of note triggers.
