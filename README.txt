Octopus is a music tracker that is inspired by both octamed and fasttracker.
There are many useful key-commands to make for an efficient keyboard oriented workflow. (Is a bit of a learning curve but should be pretty easy for octamed users)
The audio processing is bare bones in order to provide a gritty sound. 
Samples are converted to 12bit resolution as a middle ground between 8bit grime and 16bit shimmer.
